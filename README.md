# CareLink: Connecting Doctors and Patients

CareLink is a telemedicine platform designed to improve healthcare access for rural and underserved communities. This project is being developed as part of the Senior Project I & II at Howard Universityâ€™s College of Engineering and Architecture during Fall 2024 - Spring 2025.

Our mission is to bridge the gap in healthcare accessibility by leveraging technology to connect patients and healthcare providers, even in areas with low internet connectivity.

## Project Overview

CareLink aims to address the following challenges:

- **Prescription Management**: A built-in system to issue and manage prescriptions.
- **Local Healthcare Resource Recommendations**: Suggestions for nearby clinics and pharmacies for follow-up care.
- **Accessibility Options**: High-contrast modes, screen-reader compatibility, and customizable interfaces for inclusivity.
